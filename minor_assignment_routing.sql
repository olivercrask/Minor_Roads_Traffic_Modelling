-- The pgRouting Dijkstra algorithm is run here
-- There are two runs: the major road enclosed minor roads and the coastal minor roads
-- The output is a table of all minor road IDs and a count of the number of times they are 
-- traversed. The results are then used in the next step (minor_assignment_index,sql)
-- to standardise these counts to a comparable index
